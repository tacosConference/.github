## What is the TaCoS?
The 'Tagung der Computerlinguistik-Studierenden' (TaCoS) was first organized in 1992 and takes place once every year. It offers students of computational linguistics and adjacent fields a chance to exchange views during talks and workshops. The conference is hosted by teams of student volunteers at their university. Participants traditionally receive accommodation and breakfast in exchange for a small fee. At the center of the conference stand talks, workshops, and poster sessions; each given by students for students. Established academics from the host university are invited as keynote speakers as well. In addition, there is a social program for everyone to connect and network.

Previously, the TaCoS was held together with the [STuTS](https://stuts.de/) but because of increasing interest, it is now being held as a separate conference. 

## The next TaCoS Conference
The next TaCoS will be hosted in Saarland, Germany! Check out their website here: [www.tacosconference.github.io](www.tacosconference.github.io)
