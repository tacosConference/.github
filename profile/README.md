## What is TaCoS?

The “Tagung der Computerlinguistik-Studierenden” (TaCoS) is a student-led conference of Computational Linguistics. It was first organized in 1992 and takes place once every year. It offers students of Computational Linguistics and adjacent fields a chance to exchange views during talks and workshops. The conference is hosted by teams of student volunteers at their university. At the center of the conference stand talks, workshops, and poster sessions; each given by students for students. Established academics from the host university are invited as keynote speakers as well. In addition, there is a social program for everyone to connect and network.
